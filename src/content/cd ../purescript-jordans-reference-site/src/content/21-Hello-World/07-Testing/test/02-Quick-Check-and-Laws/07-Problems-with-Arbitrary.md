For more context and why these issus are bad, read to `FP Philosophical Foundations/Type Clases.md#Type Class Instances: Global vs Local` or read the beginning part of [Avoid overlapping instances with closed type families](https://kseo.github.io/posts/2017-02-05-avoid-overlapping-instances-with-closed-type-families.html).
