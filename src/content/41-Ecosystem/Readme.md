# Ecosystem

This folder is still a work-in-progress!

See [the related issues](https://github.com/JordanMartinez/purescript-jordans-reference/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AEcosystem) regarding this folder for a more up-to-date understanding.


This folder will do 3 things:
- Document 'library stacks': libraries that are often used together to solve some problem.
- Organize Purescript libraries by tag (e.g. Bindings, Typeclasses, UI, data types, etc.)
- Map out the type classes' relationships.

These topics can be read in any order.

Since this repo is meant for my learning (with your benefit), it will center around my coding interests (and not yours, unfortunately).

[This is a GitHub search](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=language%3APureScript+pushed%3A%3E2018-05-21+language%3APureScript&type=Repositories&ref=advsearch&l=PureScript&l=) of all the libraries on Github that
- are written in Purescript
- were `git push`ed after the `0.12.0` release
